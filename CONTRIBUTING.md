# Introduction

Hey there! Thanks for your interest in this PowerShell Exchange Connector based on SMLets for System Center Service Manager.
The following instructs you on the best way to interact with this project as a Contributor or if you filing a bug.

# Filing a Bug
It's possible a scenario that we've never scripted
for is encountered. Maybe something isn't working as designed. Whichever the case, you can use the Issues section to raise your
bug. Depending on the specific nature, it is possible it maybe filed as a future enhancement.

# Requesting a Feature
You can use the Issues section to raise more than just bugs. Ideas for future releases can thrown in here and will be marked as a "Feature Request"

# Contributing Guidelines
If you're interested in contributing, great! Given this script's purpose to completely swap itself with the default Exchange Connector,
it's important to keep in mind that any new functionality introduced should be kept general purpose enough to apply to all
shapes and sizes for any SCSM deployment. Proposed changes can be initiated via Forks and Pull Requests.
